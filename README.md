# State-of-the-Neighborhoods
Visualization showing the state of Walnut Creekâ€™s neighborhoods.

Every year, the Mayor of Walnut Creek gives a State of the City speech in which she or he shares stories and statistics about the health of the city as a whole. For this year, the City would like to provide a website where residents can explore information that gets even more specific and see data about the State of their Neighborhood. The City will provide several possible data sets to work with, but we are also open to your creativity. Feel free to pull in outside info as well and think about the ideal design for a site that helps residents get a snapshot on the neighborhoods of Walnut Creek. If this tool is developed, we would like to share it on our city webpage and social media channels.
